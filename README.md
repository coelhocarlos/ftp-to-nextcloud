# ftp-to-nextcloud

Allows to upload files via FTP to an OwnCloud or NextCloud server.

Useful for example for scanners/photocopier devices that have the ability to upload scans via FTP but not WebDAV.

**WORK IN PROGRESS: Does not work yet**

This project is based on the great [nodeftp](https://github.com/sstur/nodeftpd).
